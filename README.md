# AsporeZ Prototype

This is my first prototype and attempt to escape tutorial hell.

# Starter Tip

It is also my first attempt at a proper README.md so uhm... here goes.

```Lua
local love = require 'love' -- my number one reason to have chosen Love2D

function love.load()
end

function love.update(dt)
end

function love.draw()
end
```

# Idea and Content

Basic framework for building a game using the Love2D engine, has main menu, mouse cursor, input handler, basic character sprites and about 300 very basic 64x48 isometric tiles. There is a default map with 2 layers and a splash for the menu.
